# Micro-relief-Flood-Fill-Algorithm-
The Micro-relief Flood Fill Algorithm (MFF algorithm) is improved from W&amp;L Algorithm. In this algorithm, redundant points are recognized and eliminated from the process of depression filling. These source codes needs GDAL support.

You can compile these codes with Visual Studio in Windows or G++ in Linux.
Both Environment is OK. Remember setupping GDAL and making it support your programing.
Good Luck!
